    var quotes = ["Try to make a habit of remaining in Thoughtlessness.@Shriji","When you're desireless you are happy because you are never disappointed, you are never nervous. ‘Oh Lord, give me the sense of security, so that I do not feel insecure by which I trouble others, or get angry.’@Shriji","A day should come when you all will raise your heads with great pride and glory because your ideals will shine like ornaments.@Shriji","Take away my thoughts. Give me witness state by, which I see the whole drama’@Shriji","Defects are not your own. They are outside, if they fall off, you'll feel alright. You'll be perfect.@Shriji","If there are no mishaps, then you cannot see the surmounting quality of the Divine.@Shriji","‘Let me be like a flower and not like a thorn’.@Shriji","Kundalini is your Mother. She has been with you for ages and She has been waiting for this day when you could get your Realization.@Shriji","‘Let me see why people are not happy with me. Give me strength to have a sweet nature, so that others like my company, enjoy my company’.@Shriji","Surrender is not that you should give up your family, give up your children, or give up your houses and your properties. Give up your ego to begin with and then give up your conditionings.@Shriji","The person who is relaxed is extremely active on the exterior, but inside he is absolutely silent, absolutely relaxed and at ease!@Shriji","In the time of crises you should become thoughtless. That means, that God just takes you in your problems. He puts his protection and he takes you out of it.@Shriji","You have to discriminate between, ‘ego-trip’ and ascent. Ascent is where you really rise above - and with you, you make others rise! In your ascent you develop tremendous powers.@Shriji","Trust in yourself, that you can correct yourself through your Kundalini awakening, through your understanding, and clearing your chakras.@Shriji","You love and in that love reach out. Because you want others to get rid of their problems, you help and the joy of giving Realisation starts working within you to others@Shriji","You are here with a very great purpose. You should become the vehicle of God's powers, completely.@Shriji","Let your Spirit shine in such a way that people know this is a man who is completely integrated.@Shriji","Tell yourself: ‘Behave yourself. Get up in the morning, have your bath, sit down for meditation.’@Shriji","Likes and dislikes are only for people who have limited vision. You should learn to appreciate.@Shriji","‘Please keep me away from ego that gives me ideas that I am superior to others’.@Shriji","The only thing that will really give Me happiness is, the way I love you, you love each other.@Shriji","The day you start your new Divine life in the state of Nirvikalpa your meditation is very deep and intense, and your body gets filled with eternal joy and peace.@Shriji","You have got this germinating power within you, which has to rise to connect you with that all pervading subtle power of God through your Spirit.@Shriji","We should be humble and love. All this love will help you all your lift. This is the message of Christ.@Shriji","‘Give me natural humility, by which I can penetrate into the hearts of people’.@Shriji","‘Let me feel satisfaction for what I have, whatever I eat. Everything.’@Shriji","Allow your Kundalini to work it out. It works, It has worked with so many.@Shriji","Don't feel guilty in which you become very, very weak. You have to be full of enthusiasm and full of valor.@Shriji","Why don't we tell to ourselves: ‘I will be always happy, I will be happy with whatever I hear and whatever I see.’@Shriji","What you have to manage is this child which is still naughty sometimes, ties and misbehave. Now put it right. Allow that child to grow fully. ‘Give me strength, that I face myself, that I try to improve myself.’@Shriji","Love yourself! Trust that God loves you. He has chosen you, to be his instrument.@Shriji","Trust others, talk to everyone with an open heart. Have a clean, open heart like a child.@Shriji","Collectivity is the blessing of Shri Krishna. He teaches you to be collective, the fun of collectivity, the enjoyment of collectivity.@Shriji","So whatever it is, the first thing is, that you must take an attitude of a relaxed witness.@Shriji","By thinking you cannot solve your problems. You have to use your hands, not your brain.@Shriji","A relaxed person is just like a child. Relaxation never means that you are inactive.@Shriji","Now you are living, before you where dead, in the sense that before you were worshipping a dead god, called ego, now it is a living God within you, it's the Spirit.@Shriji","First of all try to trust yourself. Trust yourself, that you can correct yourself. ‘I can improve, I can do better! I have that strength within me, that I can use for my advantage!’.@Shriji","Build in your heart the experience of your own Divinity. First you have to recognize yourself to be a divine person, to have faith in yourself.@Shriji","Whatever desire you have, you say it and put it on your heart. Means you're asking from your heart. If your desires are clear-cut, then they will be fulfilled, absolutely hundred percent.@Shriji","‘Oh Lord, Give me sense of my own dignity, so that I do not feel that I'm belittled, or someone has belittled me.’@Shriji","Pray for forgiveness: ‘Because I have been ignorant, I did not know what to do, I have done mistakes. So please forgive me.’@Shriji","So you have to not fight yourself but to tame yourself and this is very easy. That is how you have to grow, into that collective being.@Shriji","Wherever my attention is going, please give me strength to pull it back. Teach me how to avoid things that tempt me, that take away my attention.@Shriji","Just start feeling your heart, opening it out - not your mouth so much as your heart.@Shriji","We have to be very courageous, very bold on the same time extremely humble.@Shriji","Whenever we get any unbalance or catch from outside we have to keep the meditation till that catch is removed.@Shriji","There is nothing to be upset. These are all different tests which will work out the goodness in you.@Shriji","Put your attention to your Sahasrara. Any thought coming, say ‘Not this, not this, not this!’@Shriji","In thoughtless awareness nobody can touch you.@Shriji","In Yoga Se Hi HOGA you don't have to achieve anything. You become and then mentally you understand Yoga Se Hi HOGA.@Shriji","In thoughtless awareness you discover, what is right, what is wrong.@Shriji","You depend only on yourself on the source of the spirit, the joy of your spirit. You don't expect others to give you joy.@Shriji","By coming into Yoga Se Hi HOGA you have become Leela (playful). You get completely absorbed in music and enjoy it.@Shriji","So try to make peace within yourself. Do not fight with yourself.@Shriji","God has prepared you now to settle into His Kingdom. That is your throne It's your right to be there.@Shriji","Everything becomes perfect as soon as you perfect yourself.@Shriji","Just bend your head and go to your heart, where resides the Spirit. Be with it.@Shriji","Your heart must be a awakened. In the heart resides the spirit, which is flowing in our consciousness, in our central nervous system.@Shriji","Try to stop thinking, because now your mind has thought for at least seven lives ahead. You don't need any more thinking, you have done enough.@Shriji","Once you accept your Spirit, all your priorities will change, because Spirit is joy and happiness. Spirit is everything@Shriji","Do not try to condemn yourself for anything. That is forbidden in Yoga Se Hi HOGA, you know that. You are all saints!@Shriji","Put a Bandhan on your heart. Whatever desire you have, you say it and put it on your heart. Seven times, you just give it a bandhan and the work will be done@Shriji","All the powers that are within you will start manifesting when you show your valor.@Shriji","My job is to encourage you, to tell you about your inner subtleties about your beauty. Do you know what beautiful thing you are?@Shriji","Just imagine a house which is standing on rocks. Like that you are. Try to feel it, feel the rock within you@Shriji","It is very important for us to get depth within and to give joy from that depth is equally important.@Shriji","When you are giving vibrations for example to a field of weed. They can be multiplied, they can be ten times more.@Shriji","So we have to trust in ourselves and we have to really love people.@Shriji","So devotion to Me means actually facing yourself, see for yourself what you are doing.@Shriji","Put your attention on positivity and not on negativity.@Shriji","If suddenly a negative force comes in to trouble you - so what? If there is no darkness, how will you know you are the light.@Shriji","So we worship Mother Earth, the sun, the moon, everything around us, which has helped us. We worship our parents, but above all we worship ourselves, because we are worship-able.@Shriji","We are the Spirit. We are the reflection of God Almighty, which is Purity, which is Truth, which is Knowledge. We are that!@Shriji","The Kundalini has to come spontaneous. It's a living process'. After Realisation you start doing living things: You can raise the Kundalini. You can give vibrations.@Shriji","Think of good things of other people. If you have to enjoy the roses, you have to forget the thorns and enjoy the roses.@Shriji","My attention is always with you. Every time you think of Me, I'll be with you; entirely!@Shriji","Now you have become the ocean of life. The power of life has come into you.@Shriji","We have to just focus our attention in the chakra which is catching and allow the Divinity to work it out.@Shriji","Only the peace within can register whatever is auspicious, whatever is nourishing for your growth.@Shriji","So this is a very important thing, Christ has given us the weapon of forgiveness. Everyone can use that weapon, just say: ‘I forgive.’@Shriji","So reduce your thinking. Do not try to sort out things through your thinking. It will give you a serenity, a kind of a peaceful existence.@Shriji","The first of the principles of Yoga Se Hi HOGA is fortitude. Yoga Se Hi HOGA is not meant for such dainty darlings. You have to be soldiers of Yoga Se Hi HOGA@Shriji","How to open your heart: You have to have no fear in your mind, trust! Trust yourself and trust others!@Shriji","Just try to share your things, share your time, share your comforts. Share every moment of your life with others.@Shriji","You have not entered into any competition. Just relax!@Shriji",];
